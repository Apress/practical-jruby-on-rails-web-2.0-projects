Practical JRuby on Rails Web Projects - Source Code
---------------------------------------------------

This source code is generally divided into the different chapters it appears in. The main exception is the larger projects. These will be found in the chapter corresponding to the last chapter in each part. So, the project created in Chapters 6-7-8 will be found in the directory Chapter08.

In almost all cases, the code doesn't need to be compiled. The few pieces of Java code can always be compiled with an easy javac command. The exact commands for CLASSPATH and so on can be found in the book.

The code doesn't need to be installed anywhere - it can be used directly from the exploded directories.
