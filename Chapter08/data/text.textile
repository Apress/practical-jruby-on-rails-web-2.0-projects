This is a small example of what you can do with something like
*Textile*. Most of what you'd like to do just works, so write everything
like you're used to, and it will be fine.

For example, a list of things could look like this:

* A thing
* Another thing
** Some subthings
** More subthings
* A final thing

You can also create tables and other formatting tools with Textile,
but all that information is available in the documentation, which
can be easily found with Google.
